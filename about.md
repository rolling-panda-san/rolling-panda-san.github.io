## Welcome

This website is mainly a place where I post stuff for my future self because apparently
I forget everything what I learnt after a while.
I feel I'm more memoryless than the financial market which is often assumed to be Markov
(which is not by the way!) and hence the site's name.

Hopefully this site is useful too for someone like me.
