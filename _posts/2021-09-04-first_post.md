This is the very first post that I publish via Github pages.

## Github pages

Github allows you to host a simple blog with [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)
and its theme is forked from [TeXt](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) with minor twists based on my personal preference.

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for taking notes because
it's lightweight and notes are constructed by markdown files.
Each post on Jykyll is also made by markdown which makes it easier to port articles from one to the other.

## Mathjax support

I might write some equations and the support for Mathjax is a plus.

$$E = mc^2$$

## Code block

I also might throw in some code snippets if I feel like it.

{% highlight python %}
def hello():
    print('hello')
{% endhighlight %}

## Local development

A local server can be launched by executing the code below. The site will be available on
http://localhost:4000.

{% highlight bash %}
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}
